          A launch vehicle or a carrier rocket is a rocket propelled vehicle
          <br />
          used to carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to
          <br />
          Earth orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most
          <br />
          powerful in operation. Styanding 150 metres tall, it's quite an <br />
          awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!
