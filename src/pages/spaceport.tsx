          A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or receiving)
          spacecraft, by analogy to the <br />
          seaport for ships or airport for aircraft. Based in the famous Cape
          Canaveral, our spaceport is <br />
          ideally situated to take advantage of the Earth's rotation for launch.
